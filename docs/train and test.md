STANet was implemented using the SoyUAV2022SY dataset and the PyTorch 1.11.0 framework. The Adam optimizer with a cross-entropy loss function was utilized to train the STANet. The training process spanned 200 epochs with a batch size of 4. The initial learning rate was 0.001 and reduced by 50% if the validation loss did not improve over 5 consecutive epochs. Meanwhile, the minimum learning rate was capped at 6.25 Ã— 10-5. F1-score (F1) was used to evaluate validation accuracy. The best model for testing was selected based on the highest F1 achieved on the validation dataset. All experiments were conducted on a Windows server equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 3060 GPU (12GB memory), a 6-core 2.50 GHz CPU, and 16GB of RAM.
